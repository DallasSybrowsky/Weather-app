# Weather Dashboard

## Background

This week's assignment was to create a weather dashboard with current forecast as well as a 5-day forecast for a city input to the search bar. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were all created by me. The data is derived from two third-party APIs, both of which are from Open Weather.

The page is dynamically built and stores past searches in local storage. Additionally recent serach buttons are created and allow the user to easily search again for previously-searched locations. 

Please see the repo at: https://github.com/DallasSybrowsky/Weather-app

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Method

The page structure, while defined by the image provided in the homework, was built from scratch. I coded the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used moment.js and bootstrap in my JavaScript and CSS, respectively.
